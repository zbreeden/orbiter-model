# Orbiter Model

**Modular Decision Model for Strategic Detachment and Alignment Drift Monitoring**

Orbiter is part of a triple-system suite (Orbiter, Anchor, Catalyst) designed to simulate orbital behavior, external signal tracking, and recalibration logic. It supports strategic detachment, pattern recognition, and drift analysis across dynamic environments.

---

## üß† Core Functions
- **Alignment Drift Monitoring**: Detects deviation from strategic baselines.
- **Signal Tracking**: Captures and interprets external inputs for recalibration.
- **Orbital Simulation**: Models cyclical engagement and detachment patterns.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repo Structure
| Folder      | Purpose                                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `data/`     | Raw and processed datasets for signal and drift analysis |
| `notebooks/`| Exploratory analysis, model prototyping                  |
| `scripts/`  | Core logic, scoring algorithms, and utility functions    |
| `models/`   | Saved model artifacts and versioned logic                |
| `docs/`     | Documentation, lifecycle diagrams, and meta reflections  |
| `tags/`     | Symbolic markers for thread closure and model evolution  |

---

## üîÑ Lifecycle Logic
Orbiter operates in three phases:
1. **Drift Detection**
2. **Signal Capture**
3. **Recalibration Trigger**

Each phase is modular and can be adapted to different strategic contexts.

---

## üß≠ Integration
Orbiter interfaces with:
- **Anchor**: For grounding and strategic reattachment
- **Catalyst**: For initiating transformation or pivot logic

---

## üß™ Status
- Repo initialized and synced ‚úÖ
- Lifecycle scaffold in progress
- README refinement underway

---

Let me know if you want to:
- Expand any section (e.g., lifecycle logic, integration protocols)
- Add symbolic tags or meta reflections
- Draft README variants for Anchor or Catalyst

We can tag this pivot as `orbiter-readme-refine` and keep building.# orbiter-model
